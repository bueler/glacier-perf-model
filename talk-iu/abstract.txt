TITLE: Glacial flows simulated faster

SPEAKER: Ed Bueler, Univerity of Alaska Fairbanks

ABSTRACT:  This is a numerical analysis talk about a climate change topic, starting from PDE-type models of how ice flows in glaciers and ice sheets.  The essential equations for modeling ice flow will be presented assuming no prior knowledge, accessible to anyone interested in fluid motion.  Glacier and ice sheet flows are of a free-boundary character, with both inequality and equality constraints, and well-posedness is mostly unknown, though progress is being made.  Current-technology numerical models mostly solve Stokes-type problems, often simplified, at every explicit time-step.   Scale analysis shows why this design is inefficient.  Building significantly-faster high-resolution models requires new techniques, and I'll try to survey some near-term improvements and longer-term strategies.
